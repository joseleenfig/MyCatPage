            <u>9 Lives</u>
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Cats have many Super natural powers that many aren't aware of. As a former dog person, I rescued a cat and ever since I have been 
            <br>a cat lover. Cat's connection to the paranormal world stems from their senses and influencing the electromagnetic fields. Cat's are also known for being able 
            <br>to tap into other dimensions. Not only so, they have great night visions,hunting skills, reflexes, and many say they have <u>9 lives.</u> </strong> <br>

            <br>Cat's are also know to be superior in Egypt history.<br>
             
              Cats in Egypt were very popular due to their jobs cleaning out and protecting grain. The Cat's in Egypt had a very important job, being that grain was their main
              <br>source of food. Egyptian cats were called Mau, not only did they believe they were important for protecting their crops, but also protectors from bad energy.<br>
